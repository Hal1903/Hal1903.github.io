  <h2>0. What Generative AI Actually Is</h2>
  <p>
    Generative AI (especially Large Language Models, or LLMs) is not a thinking machine.
    It is a probability engine. It predicts the most likely next word (or pixel, or sound)
    based on patterns learned from massive amounts of data.
  </p>
  <p>
    In simple terms: it makes highly educated guesses.
    During training, the model repeatedly guesses the next word and adjusts itself to minimize error (loss).
    After billions of corrections, it becomes very good at predicting useful sequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    It does not “understand” truth the way humans do.
    It predicts what is statistically coherent.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What LLMs Are Good At</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing Excel or spreadsheet formulas</li>
    <li>Generating and debugging code</li>
    <li>Explaining difficult textbook concepts in simpler language</li>
    <li>Rewriting text for clarity or tone</li>
    <li>Summarizing long documents</li>
    <li>Providing alternative perspectives on a problem</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    One powerful use is perspective expansion. If you are stuck in one viewpoint,
    asking an LLM for alternative interpretations can reduce blind spots.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another practical use: asking for structured outputs (tables, outlines, step-by-step plans).
    LLMs are very strong at formatting information clearly.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Other Forms of Generative AI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Image generation (design mockups, illustrations)</li>
    <li>Presentation slide generation</li>
    <li>Video generation</li>
    <li>Voice synthesis</li>
    <li>Automatic transcription</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These tools dramatically reduce production time. Tasks that once required
    specialized skills can now be prototyped quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>3. What We Should Keep in Mind</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hallucination:</strong> The model may produce confident but incorrect answers.</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmation bias:</strong> If you ask leading questions, it will reinforce your bias.</li>
    <li><strong>Context limits:</strong> It may forget earlier parts of long conversations.</li>
    <li><strong>No real-world awareness:</strong> It does not verify facts unless connected to live data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Always verify important information. Treat it as a smart assistant, not an authority.
  </p>

  <h2>4. What LLMs Are Bad At</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Guaranteed factual precision without verification</li>
    <li>Complex long-term planning with many constraints</li>
    <li>True understanding of emotions or lived experience</li>
    <li>Consistent reasoning across very long contexts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    They are also not strong at personal taste tasks such as highly refined music
    recommendation without detailed user context.
  </p>

  <h2>5. A Practical Way to Use GenAI</h2>
  <p>
    The best way to use GenAI is not to replace thinking,
    but to accelerate thinking.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use it to draft, then refine yourself.</li>
    <li>Use it to explore ideas, then validate them.</li>
    <li>Use it to automate repetitive tasks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you rely on it blindly, your thinking weakens.
    If you use it strategically, your productivity multiplies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Generative AI is a probability-based tool that can amplify productivity,
    creativity, and learning speed. It is neither magic nor intelligence in the
    human sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key is understanding both its strengths and its limitations.
    Used correctly, it becomes one of the most powerful everyday computer tools available.

    <b>P.S. </b> Did you realize that this entire article was generated by an LLM, within a few minutes? 
    I wrote the outline, key points, and web templates...but the actual prose was produced by ChatGPT 4.0o. 
    Only this P.S. section is written by me, to clarify the process.
    LLMs assisted me to write other articles, too, but this one really has the minimal human editing. 
    It's a demonstration of how it can be used to quickly generate readable content from structured ideas.
    I hope you found this humorous yet informative!
