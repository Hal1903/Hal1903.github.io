    Touch typing is a fundamental skill for becoming comfortable with computers.
    Just like arithmetic is essential for enjoying advanced mathematics,
    touch typing is a foundational step toward programming and technical work.
    It removes friction between your thoughts and the screen.
    But how should we practice?

<h3>0. Typing.com</h3>

<p>
    For absolute beginners, 
    <a href="https://www.typing.com/student/lessons">Typing.com</a> 
    offers structured, step-by-step lessons.
    It starts with individual keys, then gradually moves to words and full sentences.
    There is also a test mode that evaluates your paragraph-level typing speed and accuracy.

<h3>1. Sushida / 寿司打</h3>

<p>
    If you are learning (or interested in learning) Japanese, 
    <a href="https://sushida.net/">Sushida</a> is one of the most enjoyable typing games I can recommend.
    It combines typing practice with a fun sushi-themed challenge,
    making repetition much less boring.

<h3>2. MonkeyType</h3>

<p>
    If you prefer practicing in English, 
    <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType</a> is a fantastic option.
    You can choose from different modes such as word lists, quotes, or timed challenges.
    It gives detailed feedback on both speed and accuracy.
    My personal favorite is the “English 450k” word set, 
    which includes less common vocabulary and makes the practice more challenging.

<h3> Typical Level </h3>
<p>
    Of course, standards vary, but in my view, 
    an average typing speed falls somewhere between 25 and 45 WPM. 
    From there, many people can gradually reach around 60-65 WPM with moderate amount of practice. 
    At this level, typing usually stops feeling stressful or effortful.
</p>

<p>
    While 60-70 WPM may not be considered “excellent,” 
    it aligns quite well with normal thinking speed. 
    You no longer need to consciously focus on the keyboard — 
    your thoughts can flow naturally onto the screen. 
    You should be able to type and think simultaneously like verbal communicaiton.
    And that is when typing truly becomes a tool, rather than an obstacle.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
        
<p>
    When your fingers move effortlessly, your thoughts can flow without interruption. 
    Just like mastering arithmetic opens the door to higher mathematics, 
    mastering typing removes a hidden barrier between you and deeper work on the computer. 
    A small daily practice compounds into a powerful skill, so, do your best!
