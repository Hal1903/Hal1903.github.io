                    The concept of the <strong>mean</strong> is often introduced in elementary school as the "average," 
                    which is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the number of values.
                    For example, if four people score 40, 85, 65, and 90 on a test, 
                    the mean (average) is 
                    <Inline math="(40+85+65+90) \div 4 = 70" /> points. 
                    In a bar chart, this would represent the height if you made all the bars equal. 
                    The mean is often used as an indicator of the overall performance level of the group.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the other hand, there is also the <strong>median</strong>, which represents the “middle” of the data. 
                    To find it, we first sort the data from lowest to highest (or vice versa). 
                    For example, the median of the same four scores is 
                    <Inline math="(65+85) \div 2 = 75.5" /> points. 
                    If we had someone scoring 70 points, that is the score in the middle, so the median would be 70 points.

                <p>
                    When and why should we use one instead of the other? 
                    Imagine you want to work at a company with a high salary. 
                    Suppose Company A has an average salary of 10 million yen, 
                    while Company B has an average of 6 million yen. 
                    At first glance, A looks more attractive. 
                    But what if the salary distribution in Company A looks like this:
                </p>

                <div style={{textAlign: "center", margin: "1.5rem 0"}}>
                    <img src="\images\articles\reason\1-3\stat1.png" alt="Salary distribution" style={{width: "90%"}} />
                </div>

                <p>
                    Wouldn’t Company B seem like a better choice? 
                    The mean in A is pulled upward by a few people earning more than 20 million yen, 
                    but that doesn’t mean your salary would be that high. 
                    Realistically, you might end up with 4 or 5 million yen. 
                    In contrast, Company B has a more balanced spread, 
                    and earning 6 million yen there doesn’t look unrealistic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This difference shows up in the mean and median values, 
                    and it highlights why it is important to use them appropriately. 
                    If the data is evenly distributed, like in Company B, 
                    the mean and median are roughly the same and can be treated as such. 
                    But when the data is skewed, you have to be careful.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <b>Mode</b> is simply the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It could be one value, multiple values, or none at all.
                    In the example of salaries at Company A above, 300 and 450 are the modes.
                    In the example of test scores (40, 85, 65, 90), there is no mode since all scores are unique without repetition.

                <h3>Practice Problems</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem 1: </strong>  
                    Write the expressions for the mean and median of  
                    <Inline math="\hspace{5pt} \{45, 45, 55, 65, 70, 80\}" />. Also, 
                    find the mode of the dataset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Problem 2: </strong>  
                    Shohei Ohtani's annual salary is about 2 billion yen (which is, incredibly enormous). 
                    If you want to know the average income of people who graduated the same high school at the same time as him, 
                    should you use the mean or the median?
